// Algorithms Program #7 - Knapsack Shopping
//============================================

Walmart is having a special sale where one person can take one of each object
for an extremely low price. The Johnsons are going to go with their whole family.
Every person can take as many items as they can carry out of Walmart. They are given
a list of objects with the prices and weight of each object. There is also a maximum
weight that every person can carry. Your objective is to find the max value of 
objects the Johnsons can buy.

Input:

The input will begin with the number of test cases, T.

Each case begins with the number of objects, N. Then N lines follow, with each line
containing 2 integers: P and W where P is the price of an object and W is the 
weight. The next line consists of one integer, G, that represents the number of 
people going shopping. Then G lines follow, with each line containg 1 integer, M,
that represents the max weight the i-th member of the group can carry.

Output:

You will output one integer (max value of goods the Johnsons can buy).
